# json-typescript-mapper

## Introduction

For single page application, data sources are obtained from API server. Instead of directly using api data, we 
definitely require an adapter layer to transform data as needed. Furthermore, 
the adapter inverse the the data dependency from API server(API Server is considered uncontrollable and 
highly unreliable as data structure may be edit by backend coder for some specific purposes)to our adapter 
which becomes reliable. Thus, this library is created as the adapter make use of es7 reflect decorator.

### Get Started
```bash
npm install typescript-json-mapper --save
```
## Environment
* NodeJS
* Browser

## Language
* Typescript
* Javascript (Typescript will eventually compile to js.)

### Typescript & ES6

```bash
import {deserialize} from 'typescript-json-mapper';

deserialize(<Class Type>, <JSON Object>);
```

## Example 
Here is a complex example, hopefully could give you an idea of how to use it (for more on how to use, checkout /spec which are unit test cases):

```bash
class Student {
    @JsonProperty('name')
    fullName:string;

    constructor() {
        this.fullName = undefined;
    }
}

class Address {
    @JsonProperty('first-line')
    firstLine:string;
    @JsonProperty('second-line')
    secondLine:string;
    @JsonProperty({clazz: Student})
    student:Student;
    city:string;

    constructor() {
        this.firstLine = undefined;
        this.secondLine = undefined;
        this.city = undefined;
        this.student = undefined
    }
}

class Person {
    @JsonProperty('Name')
    name:string;
    @JsonProperty('xing')
    surname:string;
    age:number;
    @JsonProperty({clazz: Address, name: 'AddressArr'})
    addressArr:Address[];
    @JsonProperty({clazz: Address, name: 'Address'})
    address:Address;

    constructor() {
        this.name = undefined;
        this.surname = undefined;
        this.age = undefined;
        this.addressArr = undefined;
        this.address = undefined;
    }
}
```

Now here is what API server return, assume it is already parsed to JSON object.
```bash
let json = {
  "Name": "Mark",
  "xing": "Galea",
  "age": 30,
  "AddressArr": [
      {
          "first-line": "Some where",
          "second-line": "Over Here",
          "city": "In This City",
          "student": {
              name1: "Ailun"
          }
      },
      {
          "first-line": "Some where",
          "second-line": "Over Here",
          "city": "In This City",
          "student": {
              name1: "Ailun"
          }
      }
  ],
  "Address": {
      "first-line": "Some where",
      "second-line": "Over Here",
      "city": "In This City",
      "student": {
          name: "Ailun"
      }
  }
```

Simply, just map it use following code. The mapping is based on <@JsonProperty> decorator meta data.

```bash
const person = deserialize(Person, json);
```

## Test Report
The test case will be covered in the next push. This caused by inconsistent return type.

## Roadmap:
1) Fully json mapping to the modal class convention should be provided. 
If any unmapped variable discover, throw exception! 
This could be useful to detect if API data has change it data structure in the unit testing phrase.

2) Runtime data type validation might be a good idea. Alternatively, if this feacture is not covered in the future, I will make use of json schema concept instead.
